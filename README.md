# React Cards UI

This project is a user interface built using React.js, featuring a card-based layout. It utilizes React Icons for icon integration, React Toastify for displaying toasts, and React Loaders to enhance the user experience. The project is developed with the Vite package, and during its creation, I gained practical knowledge of React concepts such as useState and useEffect hooks, as well as Tailwind CSS for styling and prop drilling.
